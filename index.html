It's funny.<br> <strong>When I was a little boy and told people I was going to be a comedian, everyone laughed at me. Well, no one's laughing now!</strong><br> I'm not good at future planning. I do not plan at all. Don't know what I'm doing tomorrow. Do not have a day planner and <del>don't have a diary.</del></p>
